# This Wikipedia page has a table with data on all of the US Presidential elections. 
# Our goal is to use Beautiful Soup to scrape some of this data into a CSV file. 
# The columns of the CSV should be: 
# 	order, 
#	year, 
#	winner,
#	winner electoral votes, 
#	runner-up, and 
#	runner-up electoral votes. 
# Use commas as the delimiter.

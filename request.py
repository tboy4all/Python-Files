 
# Using the requests module and the OMDB API, build an application that prompts 
# the user for two pieces of information, the name of an actor/actress and a movie. 
# Your program should tell the user if that actor or actress was in that movie 
# (this will only work for leading actors and actresses). 

# As a bonus, add functionality to tell users who the director and writer of a movie were.
